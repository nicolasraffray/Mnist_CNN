# CNN 

The perpose of this project is to get to grips with keras and tensorflow by trying to classify handwritten digits from the mnist dataset. Along with to test my understanding of CNNs. Currently I'm not sure if the CNN architecture is optimal but will look into the most optimal network for the problem when the model is up and running.
